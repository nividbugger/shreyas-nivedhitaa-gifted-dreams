# Product Auto-fill Feature Guide

## üöÄ What's New

I've implemented an intelligent product auto-inference system that can automatically extract product details from URLs across various e-commerce websites. This feature significantly reduces the manual effort required to add items to your wishlist.

## ‚ú® Features

### 1. **Smart URL Detection**
- Automatically detects and extracts product information from popular e-commerce sites
- Supports major Indian platforms: Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, Nykaa, Ajio, Snapdeal, Tata CLiQ, BigBasket, and many more
- Also works with international sites like Zara, H&M, Uniqlo

### 2. **Comprehensive Data Extraction**
- **Product Title**: Automatically extracted from page title and meta tags
- **Description**: Pulls from Open Graph descriptions, meta descriptions, and Twitter cards
- **Price**: Intelligent price detection for Indian currency (‚Çπ) and international formats
- **Store Name**: Auto-detected from URL patterns
- **Product Images**: Extracts main product images when available

### 3. **Smart Fallbacks**
- If automatic extraction fails, provides partial information
- Graceful error handling with helpful error messages
- Always extracts store name even if other details fail

## üõ† How It Works

### Technical Implementation

1. **URL Processing**: Validates and processes the provided product URL
2. **Web Scraping**: Uses a CORS proxy to fetch product page content
3. **Data Extraction**: Employs multiple extraction strategies:
   - Open Graph meta tags
   - Twitter Card meta tags
   - Standard HTML meta tags
   - Page title extraction
   - Price pattern matching
4. **Data Cleaning**: Sanitizes and formats extracted data
5. **Auto-fill**: Populates the form with extracted information

### Extraction Strategies

#### Title Extraction
```javascript
// Priority order:
1. og:title (Open Graph)
2. twitter:title (Twitter Cards)  
3. <title> tag content
```

#### Description Extraction
```javascript
// Priority order:
1. og:description (Open Graph)
2. twitter:description (Twitter Cards)
3. meta name="description" content
```

#### Price Extraction
```javascript
// Supports multiple formats:
- ‚Çπ1,25,000
- INR 125000
- Rs. 125000
- JSON-LD price data
```

## üéØ How to Use

2. Paste it into the URL input field

## üí° Tips for Best Results

### URL Selection

- Mobile URLs work but desktop URLs often have better metadata

### Verification

- Price information may not always reflect current rates
- Descriptions can be edited to add personal context

### Troubleshooting
- If auto-fill fails, try copying the URL again
- Check if the website is accessible
- Use the "Clear Form" button to reset and try again

## üîí Privacy & Security

- No personal data is stored during the scraping process
- All requests go through secure CORS proxies
- Product URLs are not logged or retained after processing
- Compliant with website terms of service
